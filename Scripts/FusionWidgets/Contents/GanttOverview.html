    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>The Gantt chart is a specialized chart used for displaying various timelines like project timelines, development timelines etc. It can be used for any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Planning and scheduling projects. </li>
        <li> Assessing how long a project should take. </li>
        <li> Laying out the order in which tasks need to be carried out. </li>
        <li> Managing dependencies between tasks. </li>
        <li> Determining the resources needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In short, Gantt charts help you monitor progress of a project. You can immediately see what should have been achieved at a point in time. Also, they allow you to judge how remedial action may bring the project back on course, if it's running off the track.</p>
