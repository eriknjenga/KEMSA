    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>FusionWidgets v3 (previously FusionGadgets &amp; FusionCharts Instrumentation Suite) is a collection of real-time gauges and charts for use in dynamic web applications.  It is a part of FusionCharts v3 suite, but works independently of other products in the suite. </p>
      <p>Made in Adobe Flash 8, FusionWidgets can be used with any web scripting 
        language like HTML, .NET, ASP, JSP, PHP, ColdFusion etc., as it uses XML 
        as the interface. It makes full use of the fluid beauty of Adobe Flash to 
      create <strong>compact</strong>, <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>visually-arresting</strong> charts. </p>
      <p>FusionWidgets can be effectively used to develop financial applications, instrument panels, executive dashboards, live &quot;up-to-second&quot; stock monitors and manufacting process monitoring applications. Perfectly suited for data visualization and analysis requirements, where KPI's (Key Performance Indicators) and other critical data is monitored in real time, FusionWidgets brings the combined experience of programmers and graphic visualizers to you in a set of extremely easy-to-use controls. <br />

          <td><p>In traditional image based charting systems, the charts are generated 
              as image at the server side. So, for each chart that you need to 
              serve to a user, you'll have to build complex images on the server 
              and then stream it to the client. When the need of hour is high, 
              this can be an expensive resource on the server, as image creation 
              takes a lot of toll on the server. </p>
            <p>FusionWidgets brings you relief here - all the charts are rendered 
              at client side using the widely installed Adobe Flash Platform. 
              The server is just responsible for streaming the pre-built SWF files 
              and your XML data files to the end viewers. From there on, Flash 
              Player takes the onus of rendering the charts. Also, the chart SWF 
              Files can be cached so that you can just update the data, and not 
              send chart SWF files every time.</p></td>

              Once you buy a license of FusionWidgets, you can host it on multiple 
              servers, if all those servers are hosting the same website. We offer 
              unlimited development servers, unlimited test servers and unlimited 
              CPUs on a given server with each license of FusionWidgets.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if you're using multiple technologies for the same application 
              - like say, ASP for a few modules and PHP for a few modules, you 
              can use FusionWidgets for both of them, without having to pay us 
              anything additional. This saves you a lot on licensing cost and
