      <ol>
        <li>Create a folder named <span class="codeInline">FusionWidgets</span> 
          in the root of your application. Note that, it's not mandatory to name 
          the folder as <span class="codeInline">FusionWidgets</span> or create 
          it under root folder. However, doing this way organizes things a lot 
          more, as all the pages within your website can now access the common 
          set of charts.</li>
        <li>Copy all the SWF files from <span class="codeInline">Download Package 
          &gt; Charts</span> Folder and now paste it in this folder.</li>
        <li>Installation Complete - Yes, there's no more step involved - you're 
          now ready to use FusionWidgets in your web application, which will soon 
          see.</li>

        <li>Create a folder named <span class="codeInline">FusionWidgets</span> 
          inside this. Again note that, it's not mandatory to name the folder 
          as <span class="codeInline">FusionWidgets</span> or create it as a new 
          folder. However, doing this way organizes things a lot more.</li>
        <li>Copy all the SWF files from <span class="codeInline">Download Package 
          &gt; Charts</span> Folder and now paste it in this folder.</li>
        <li>That completes the installation for FusionWidgets. Now, all you need 
          to do is build your XML data and HTML page, which we'll see next.</li>
